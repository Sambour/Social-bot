I just saw Inception. It is an amazing idea to see actions in dreams. Dream in a dream, so crazy!

Yeah I truly agree! Also for his work in Batman Dark Knight, as well as Interstella. The grand of universe, That mysterious and profound feeling is vividly reflected

Actually I didn't watch Dunkirk before. Can you tell me briefly what it is about?




Yeah and also the idea that time flows in different speed in different levels of dreams. This makes it possible for people to live half of their life in their dream but just in couple of hours in reality.
