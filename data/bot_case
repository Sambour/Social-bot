I just read the Little Prince. It is a fantastic story with great imagination!

I agree. And I also admire the pure relationship of the prince and the rose. It is love, isn't it? As the fox said, he is tamed by the rose.

Yep. I still remember the lamplighter on a small planet. It symbols the vast people who live their lives muddling around not knowing the meaning of life
